# ChurnSpeak: Predicting Customer Departure with NLP-Driven Feedback Insights

Welcome to the ChurnSpeak project.
This project combines machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to help businesses predict customer churn and uncover meaningful insights from customer feedback. The goal is to enable companies to take proactive steps to improve customer retention before it’s too late.

## Overview

Understanding why customers leave is one of the most important challenges for subscription-based businesses. This project helps address that by using historical data and customer feedback to predict churn and identify patterns behind customer dissatisfaction.

The project uses structured data analysis alongside customer feedback analysis powered by NLP, creating a more complete view of the customer’s journey and their likelihood of leaving. Logistic Regression is used as the core predictive model.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

Churn_Analysis_with_NLP/
├── data/
│   └── telco_churn.csv               # Raw dataset
├── model/
│   └── churn_prediction_model.pkl    # Trained machine learning model
├── scripts/
│   ├── data_preprocessing.py         # Cleans and prepares the data
│   ├── churn_model.py                # Trains the prediction model
│   └── predict_churn.py              # Predicts churn for new data
├── README.md                         # Documentation for the project
├── LICENSE                           # Open-source license file (MIT)
├── requirements.txt                  # Python packages needed for the project

## How to Use This Project

Step 1: Install the required Python libraries  
Before using the code, install the dependencies by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 2: Train the churn prediction model  
Once the setup is complete, train your churn model using:

python scripts/churn_model.py

This will save the trained model as churn_prediction_model.pkl in the model folder.

Step 3: Predict customer churn  
After training, you can use the prediction script to check if a customer is likely to leave:

python scripts/predict_churn.py

## Technology Used

This project is built using Python 3 and popular open-source libraries:

- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for optional data visualization
- NLTK or spaCy for natural language processing
