# ChurnSpeak: Predicting Customer Departure with NLP-Driven Feedback Insights

Welcome to the **ChurnSpeak** project!  
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer is likely to leave (churn) based on their usage patterns and service data, combined with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract insights from customer feedback.

## 🚀 Overview

Customer churn prediction is a critical problem for subscription-based businesses. Using historical data, this project builds a churn prediction model that helps Telco companies proactively identify customers who are at risk of leaving.

The project uses:
- Structured data analysis for churn prediction.
- NLP techniques (if applicable) to analyze and extract insights from customer feedback.
- Logistic Regression to make predictions about churn.

## 💡 How to Use

### Step 1️⃣ Install Required Libraries

Open your terminal and install the project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2️⃣ Train the Model

Run the following command to preprocess the data and train the model:

```bash
python scripts/churn_model.py
```

The trained model will be saved in the `model/` folder as `churn_prediction_model.pkl`.

### Step 3️⃣ Make Predictions

Once the model is trained, you can predict customer churn:

```bash
python scripts/predict_churn.py
```

This will load the saved model and output predictions on new or existing customer data.
